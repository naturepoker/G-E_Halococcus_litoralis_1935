## Schoop, G. Halococcus litoralis, an obligate halophilic colorant. German veterinary weekly. 1935;43:817-20.

This repository contains a rough translation of the classic 1935 paper:

***Schoop, G. Halococcus litoralis, ein obligat halphiler Farbstoffbildner. Deutsche Tierärztliche Wochenschrift. 1935;43:817–20.***

Above paper is notable for being the first to treat cocci-forming halophilic microbes as separate from other red-colored microbes forming on hypersaline samples. 

The authors succeeded in isolating pure cultures of the cocci forming halophilic microbes from mixed samples and propagated them on artificial media for 7 years. They go on to suggest that Micrococcus litoralis described in below publication be reclassified as a Halococcus litoralis based on observed characteristics shared with the types of red-hued microbes forming obligately on high salinity samples and artifical media of 15% NaCl concentration and above. 

***Kellermann, K. F.: Micrococci causing red detoration of salted codfish. Zbl. Bakter. II. 42, 398 (1915)***

However, it would take until 1973 study of Kocur M. and Hodgkiss W. for the suggestion to finally be accepted as the de-facto taxonomic classification for these genus of Haloarchaeal microbes, as decribed in below publication.

***Kocur M, Hodgkiss W. Taxonomic status of the genus Halococcus Schoop. International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology. 1973 Apr 1;23(2):151-6.***

It should be noted that above 1973 paper also found Sarcina litoralis, Micrococcus litoralis, Sarcina morrhuae and Micrococcus morrhuae as taxonomic synonyms of each other, and they've all been consolidated as Halococcus morrhuae in modern days. So in a way, this 1935 publication can be seen as a continuation of the 1880 study by Farlow W.G.: 

***Farlow WG. Chapter XLIV. On the nature of the peculiar reddening of salted codfish during the summer time (as observed more particularly at Gloucester, Mass., during the summer of 1878). In: Report of the Commissioner - United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries [Internet]. 1880. p. 969–74.
