In the months of June, July, August, large quantities of salted fish are often coated with a red color in the salt and clipfish industry.

The red colorant is all the more common the further south the production of salt fish is located. In Iceland, where large quantities of clipfish are marketed, the red coloration of the saltfish is relatively rare. On the American Atlantic coast, southern France and Morocco, it is the worst thing in codfish preparation. In Germany, too, the red color of the salt fish is by no means rare, even if the literature hardly reports on it.

The changes in saltfish have received more or less attention depending on the economic importance of the saltfish industry in each country. Farlow (1878/79) describes the alga Clathrocystis roseopersicina as the cause of the red discoloration. Poulsen (1879/80) found the Sarcina litoralis in mud from the beach, which was associated with the red. Berenger-Feraud (1885) assumes mold to be the cause of the red coloration. Le Dantec (1891 and 1906) first believed that he had found the causative agent of red in a spore-forming bacillus. He deviates from this view and speaks of a bacterium, 2-15 µm long, sometimes filamentous, motile and gram-negative. The bacterium is to be aided in subtle action by other germs, a Sarcina, a gram-negative coccobacillus, and a long, vigorous, gram-positive bacillus. Hoye (1904) mentions a red Sarcina, but this is said not to play a major role in Norway. Later (1908) he speaks of red bacteria. Beckwith (1911) describes a Diplococcus gadidarum n. sp. Kellermann (1915) names two pathogens, the Diplococcus gadidarum and the Micrococcus litoralis. Klebahn (1918) found 1. a red Bacillus, Bac. halobius ruber, seen only in saline smears. Lysis immediately occurs in water. The colonies formed were vermillion red and had a greasy sheen. 2. a red sarcina, Sarcina morrhuae, which has similarly colored but less glossy colonies. 3. A red micrococcus, Micrococcus morhuae, which was gram negative but otherwise culturally behaved like the red sarcina. Martel and Germain (1921) believe they have found a new pathogen, which they call Micrococcus rubroviscosis. It has escaped the attention of observers because it turns to an unformed mass when mixed with water. Its shape can only be recognized in a highly saline medium. Aside from fish, all other salted preserves such as ham, anchovies and bacon are also likely to be affected. Browne (1922) attributes the formation of the red pigment to the symbiosis of a spirochate and a bacterium. The spirochate will produce the pale hue, the bacteria will produce the red color. Although Velu (1929) is primarily concerned with the rust-red of salted intestines, he connects the pathogen with the red of the fish. According to him, a mutation of the bacterium prodigiosum is the causative agent. Petter (1932) names Bacillus halobius ruber and Sarcina morhuae as causative agents of red pigments on salted fish. In addition, the author has found a new orange-colored microbe, Bacterium trapanicum. Bacillus halobius ruber is renamed Bacterium halobium. Petrova (1935) considers the micrococcus roseus to be the cause of redness. He explains the various forms of microbes, which have been described as pathogens, as changes in the shape of one germ in the sense of Enderlein's cyclogeny.

From these brief excerpts from the numerous literature references, which are only partially cited, it appears that the assessment of the dye-forming agent is apparently quite difficult. Almost all authors name other germs. There is agreement that 1. microbes can be the cause of the redness, 2. the isolation of the germs is difficult and 3. the germs require a high salt content in the culture medium in order to prosper.



### Our investigations

1. Fish studies 

The reddened salt fish examined were of German and foreign origin.

Macroscopic Findings: Frequently the red was confined to only small areas of the flesh side near the backbone. The transition to the non-stained parts was diffused. In some cases the entire flesh side was red, in others the skin side was more or less covered with it. The flesh side was always affected first. Depending on the moisture content of the fish, the color transition was slimy and shiny or dull and matte. The hue varied with the severity and duration of the infestation from pink to a strong brick red. If the pieces of fish were placed in damp chambers, the brick red gradually turned into a dark rusty red. At the same time it penetrated deep into the musculature, whereas in the earlier stages the staining was limited to the surface. The fish then became very tender and brittle. With the degree of change, there is also an increasing smell. It is slightly ammoniacal at first, becoming more and more stinging and putrid over time.

The changes described are not usually limited to one fish. At least they affect a whole stack in which there are many hundredweights of fish. They only occur when the fish are taken out of the brine. Often enough, however, all the stacks in a warehouse are attacked by the red at the same time, so that the salt fish manufacturers believe that the pathogen is spread through the air. The severity of the occurrence varies from year to year. It is greatest when the outside temperature is high for a long time. The discoloration then progresses rapidly, so that within 14 days all the fish in a stack or hall can be affected.
##### Microscopic Findings: 

Smears of the red plaque are often somewhat slimy and are easily spooled off the slide.

In the spreads, rods and cocci are usually present at the same time. The proportion changes.

It appeared as if cocci were predominant in the markedly red spots. The cocci are big and clumsy. They lie partly individually, partly in the form of diplo- or staphylococci. They are gram-positive, but sometimes lose some or all of the gram color, especially in older material.

Some of the sticks have a strange property. They can only be examined in high-percentage saline. If you add distilled water to the suspension liquid, they disappear. In the darkfield they are about 1-3 µm long, irregular in thickness, sometimes club-shaped. A 20 percent sodium chloride solution was used for the test.

##### Findings in culture:

a) Natural media: The discoloration is easily transferred to sterilized pieces of salted fish. The salted fish pieces were poured over Petri dishes with sterile 10% saline solution. After inoculation, a red coating developed on the surface, as on the original fish. In many cases, however, the hue deviated into yellowish. The coating was shiny and had a slimy texture. The development of the plaque lasted 14 days to 4 weeks. Microscopically, the same bacterial flora was found there as on the original fish. Formation of single colonies could not be achieved.

b) Artificial mediua: Since it was not possible to separate the different types of germs of the red clipfish on fish piece culture medium, an attempt was made with artificial culture medium, which initially had no or only unsatisfactory success. Either no germs grew at all, or the colonies that grew only on highly saline medium were not colored or only faintly colored and still proved to be mixed cultures of different microbes.

They belonged in part to the facultative halophilic microbes, particularly to the genus called "Flavobacterium" after the yellow hue of their colonies. The yellow was partly light, partly dark, fading into brownish or orange. In addition, obligate halophilic rods "Halobacteria" were regularly found.

Groups 2 and 3 were represented from the three bacterial groups listed according to their behavior towards common salt, 1. the non-halophilic or salt-sensitive germs, 2. the facultative halophilic or salt-insensitive germs and 3. the obligatory halophilic or salt germs. The non-halophilic germs, which include pathogens and putrefactive bacteria, were absent. Although several representatives of the 1st group with optional halophiles were present, none of them could be found to form a red dye. The causative agents of the red pigment of fish belonged accordingly to the 3rd group of the obligatory halophilic microbes, which, according to an earlier suggestion, should be added to the genus name with the suffix "halo-": Halococcus, Halobacterium, etc.

The difficulty in obtaining red colored colonies is mainly due to the slow development. While the sticks that have surfaced before multiply quickly and show luxuriant growth, the red dye-formers need weeks and months to appear on the culture. In many cases their growth is completely suppressed by the other germs.

It was only after months of laborious cultivation from culture to culture on salt agar that a red micrococci that produced evenly colored pigments was successfully bred. This germ turned out to be identical to the Micrococcuslitoralis (Poulsen) Kellermann 1915. Two strains of these microbes were isolated, one from German and one from Icelandic clipfish.

2. Biology of Halococcus litoralis

For fine development the germ needs a medium containing sodium chloride. 10-15 percent NaCL seems to suit him the most. It does not develop on low-salt media. The micrococcus is obligately halophilic. As a result, it is to be referred to as Halococcus litoralis.

Heavily salted fish meat causes the most favorable growth of the germ. A thick, shiny, vivid red coating forms on the fish. Growth takes 4 to 6 weeks, sometimes more. On saline agar, whether from fish or other meat, the colonies develop just as slowly or more slowly. The germs are strictly aerobic; in stab cultures they only grow on the surface. They multiply faster in liquid medium.

The morphology is the same in pure cultures as in the natural material. The germs are coarse, gram-positive micrococci, lying singly, in pairs, or in bunches. The diameter is 1-1.5 µm and above.

The growth of the Halococcus litoralis is only made possible by table salt and not by other salts. The addition of KCl, NaNO3 and KNO3 to the culture medium prevented the germ from developing. The optimal growth seems to be at 10-15 percent NaCL in the culture medium.

Best growth was observed at pH 7.6. Propagation also occurs at pH 6.8. At pH 8.0 growth was abolished

Additions of lactose and dextrose promote multiplication without disrupting the cocci structure.

The microbe forms a light brick-red pigment. The ability to form dyes was retained for years in the pure cultures. Light does not destroy the color. The hue is the same in old cultures as in fresh ones. In the case of the oldest strain, isolated in 1928, the dye formed is now somewhat lighter than at the beginning, but the color intensity varies from culture to culture.

The pathogens survive heating to 60-70C for 5 minutes. Liquid cultures stored at room temperature still contained live germs after more than 4 years. Halococci dried on silk thread showed the ability to reproduce for 3 days after drying, later no longer. On the other hand, on pieces of fish, they resist drying out for a long time.

In animal experiments on mice, rats, guinea pigs and dogs, no pathogenic effects could be detected either orally or perorally.

3. Occurrence of rotting microbial flora

If you salt non-sterilized sea fish with sterilized table salt and put it in the incubator for a few weeks, the red color can develop on it. Conversely, the red hue also occurs when sterilized fish is salted with non-sterilized sea salt. The same test remains negative if rock salt is used instead of sea salt. One can conclude from this that the Halococcus litorialis or the microbial flora necessary for reddening of the salt fish 1. adheres to the sea fish and 2. thrives in the sea salt. They were not found in the rock salts. I haven't been able to find them in seawater.

4. Combating the red of the salt fish

Experiments were carried out on the natural flora of modified clipfish. The pathogens were washed away from the red colored surface of naturally colored fish with 10-20 percent saline solution. Silk threads soaked with the run-off served as infection material for pieces of sterile saltfish. The red microbial flora developed if the fish pieces were not pretreated. 3-5 percent montamine solutions and 2-6 percent sodium bisulfite solutions proved to be effective, while hydrogen peroxide and boric acid. Caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, magnesium hypochlorite, soda and quinosol remained ineffective.



### Concluding remarks

A dye-forming cocci, the Halococcus litoralis, has been kept on artificial media for years on salt fish that have turned red in color. The ability to form red-colored colonies has not been lost through several years of breeding. However, after 7 years, the shade is sometimes paler than shortly after the pure culture was bred out. To inoculate the strains, use 1. pieces of sterilized salt fish and 2. agar with 10 percent or more NaCl additive.

The concerns of the numerous authors who have dealt with the red coloring of the salt fish differ widely. The ability to form dyes is ascribed to various germs. Above all, in addition to micrococci, obligate halophilic rods are described, which are said to form a vivid red pigment in their colonies. The detection of this bacterium, Bacterium halobium (Klebahn, Petter), was not successful on the red-colored clipfish available to me. Certainly obligate halophilic bacteria, ie members of the genus Halobacterium, were present. However, none of the strains found had the ability to form dyes.

We have, however, identified two strains of the Bact. halobium (Klebahn, Petter), kindly sent to us from the Laboratory of Microbiology, Delft University of Technology (Prof. Kluyver). One of the strains formed dark red, somewhat glaucous-translucent colonies, the other somewhat lighter, opaque colonies. As a result of its obligate halophilic trait, the germ is to be assigned to the genus Halobacterium and designated as Halobacterium halobium.

Whether the Halococcus litoralis is more common than the Halobact as a dye-forming agent on red cod. halobium - Prof. Klebahn informs us in a letter that a red micrococcus and a red sarcina live on fish and are sometimes more common than the bacillus - whether the Halobact. halobium had died off on our test material or whether we could not prove it for another reason unknown to us, cannot be decided here.

The red color on bits of cod formed in pure culture from Halococcus litoralis deviates from the natural changes in the fish in that it remains the same with increasing age. The naturally infested codfish, on the other hand, turn dark red to brown over time. In contrast to pure cultures, the processes also penetrate deep into the meat.

How far this other color formers, in particular the Halobact. halobium, or the non-dye-forming accompanying flora are involved, may remain undecided.


### Summary

Salt fish are often attacked by a microbial red.

Halococcus litoralis was isolated from red-colored clipfish of German and Icelandic origin.

The Halococcus litoralis is obligate halophilic. It forms vivid red colored colonies.

The Halococcus litoralis is strictly aerobic. Its cultures take 4-6 weeks or more to develop on medium supplemented with 10-15% NaCl.

The germ is not pathogenic for mice, rats, guinea pigs and dogs.

The Halococcus litoralis is always accompanied by a microbial flora consisting of obligate and facultative germs.

The microbial flora that causes saltfish red has been identified both on the surface of saltwater fish and in sea salt. Neither in rock salt nor in sea water has it been detected so far.

The red color did not develop on fish pieces treated with 3-5% montanine solution or 2-6% sodium bisulfite solution prior to inoculation.
